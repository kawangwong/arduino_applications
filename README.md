<h1>Purpose</h1>
The purpose of creating this repository is to host a number of self-written scripts written to be used with Arduino. Arduino is the company itself, but the devices used are called Arduino microcontrollers. A superficial description of what a microcontroller is that the device has a stored code that runs in a forever loop eitehr waiting for an input and then processing the input when the trigger for the event occurs. The benefits of this is that the device can only perform a single looped function with multiple conditions. Compared to a computer, which is a general purpose computing device that has multiple layers of software running and requires more resources, the microcontroller is a single purpose device coded to do what is told by the coder.

In short, we can call a microcontroller a really smart relay switch with high versatility and the low cost reduces the barrier to entry for any person interested in tinkering or developing a product for use to improve quality of life or even for educational purposes.

<h2>Arduino Idea</h2>
- An arudiono program that can used as a HID for connecting switches to an IO for use as input.
- Use of Arduino to send a message something happens such as a user input or a detection of something occurs.
- Control of lights through detection or some for of trigger based on user events.
